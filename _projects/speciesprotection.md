My final project at GA is site that allows you to help Protect and
adopt highly endangered species of animals from all over the planet.
As a nature lover and with the worrying potential climate changes that threaten the future of our planet, I wanted to highlight and the effects
this is having on many important Ecosystem's and the animals that live
in these habitats.
